1.
# create db in postgres google sheet data will go into
# sheets to postgres (sheets_to_postgres.py)

2.
# dump db with (simple_postgres_manager.py)
# using DB_NAME of the db you just inserted to from google sheets

3.
# create new db that the dumped db will now populate ("empty work")
# restore backup to NEW db you created thats empty that will be populated with the backup just created ("work" in this example will populate "empty_work")
# run >>>pg_restore -h "localhost" -d empty_work -U zelda "/home/batman/Desktop/google_postgres/pgbackup2021-07-25-1333.dump"

#Note: if you restore dumped db to a db that already has tables in it, it will just add that table and keep whatever tables there that already exist
